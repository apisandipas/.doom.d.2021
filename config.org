* About
This is my literate emacs config. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
I started out with a Literate Config months back when I first started using emacs. It was in fact one of the main things I first saw and realized how cool Emacs could be. But boy, it's a terrible way to start. I cannot cound the number of time I'd broken my config by trying something new out, restarting, only to reazize I'd severely broken something, left out a paren or otherwise and would have to edit the configs manually. What a nightmare.

Months later, I'm much more capable within emacs and I feel like, yeah, _I'm ready to get hurt again_.

* User Interface Tweaks


** Frame Settings
Make sure the mouse arrow renders white. IDK why, but it was showing up black for me again the dark themes made it useless.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(mouse-color . "white"))
(set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha '(75 . 80))
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(alpha . (75 . 80)))
#+end_src

** Fonts

I'm currently stuck on VictorMono. I find it readable and stylish and it comes with ligature and Nerd Font icons. Whats not to love?

*** Typeface
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq doom-font
      (font-spec :family "VictorMono Nerd Font" :size 18)
      doom-variable-pitch-font
      (font-spec  :family  "VictorMono Nerd Font" :size 18)
      doom-big-font
      (font-spec :family "VictorMono Nerd Font" :size 18))

(custom-set-faces!
  '(font-lock-comment-face :slant italic)
  '(font-lock-keyword-face :slant italic))

#+end_src

*** Sexy Ligratures
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package ligature
  :config
  (ligature-set-ligatures
   'prog-mode
   '("|||>" "<|||" "<==>" "<!--" "####" "~~>" "***" "||=" "||>"
     ":::" "::=" "=:=" "===" "==>" "=!=" "=>>" "=<<" "=/=" "!=="
     "!!." ">=>" ">>=" ">>>" ">>-" ">->" "->>" "-->" "---" "-<<"
     "<~~" "<~>" "<*>" "<||" "<|>" "<$>" "<==" "<=>" "<=<" "<->"
     "<--" "<-<" "<<=" "<<-" "<<<" "<+>" "</>" "###" "#_(" "..<"
     "..." "+++" "/==" "///" "_|_" "www" "&&" "^=" "~~" "~@" "~="
     "~>" "~-" "**" "*>" "*/" "||" "|}" "|]" "|=" "|>" "|-" "{|"
     "[|" "]#" "::" ":=" ":>" ":<" "$>" "==" "=>" "!=" "!!" ">:"
     ">=" ">>" ">-" "-~" "-|" "->" "--" "-<" "<~" "<*" "<|" "<:"
     "<$" "<=" "<>" "<-" "<<" "<+" "</" "#{" "#[" "#:" "#=" "#!"
     "##" "#(" "#?" "#_" "%%" ".=" ".-" ".." ".?" "+>" "++" "?:"
     "?=" "?." "??" ";;" "/*" "/=" "/>" "//" "__" "~~" "(*" "*)"
     "\\\\" "://"))
  (global-ligature-mode t))

(after! doom-themes
  (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t
        doom-themes-enable-italic t))

#+end_src


** Line Numbers
How anyone could ever use anything but relative line numbers is beyond me. I never did use them before I converted to vim years back, but now I don't like how I ever did without them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+end_src

** Theme Choice
This is a section I change fairly often. Most everything I have it themed after Doom One or some variant of it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (load-theme 'doom-vibrant t)
#+end_src
